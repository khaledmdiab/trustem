% This template is inspired by Dr. Hefeeda's instructions for writing our reports and publications, the order of sections follows a normal thinking model:
% - After the intro and related work, we systematically describe the "system model" or "system design". Based on the contribution, this can be abstract to define a model or specific to describe real system design.
% - Problem: we formally define the problem here, to make it clear for the reader what we are trying to solve. Figures and charts to motivate the problem are essential.
% - Solution: is often the algorithm to solve the problem alongside its analysis. Illustrative examples with figures are important.
% - Evaluation: is a major part especially if it's a system publication: evaluation setup, scenarios and results should be mentioned very clear. (1) Analysis of the results and (2) referal to the solution guarantees (if any) are very appreciated here.
% - Discussion: is essential to discuss some shortcomings and practical issues. Solution guidelines to solve shortcomings should mentioned here as well.
% - Conclusions: conclude your work and point to future work. Future work is important factor as well since it shows that you have a good research plan in mind for practical issues.

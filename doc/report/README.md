## myLatexTemplate

This Latex template is based on Network Systems Lab (NSL) template at SFU. I added the following:

- Makefile to build a PDF document from your Latex files
- Support for Tikz in creating figures
- Generate PNG files for PDF plots

### Structure

- Root directory should contain all the Tex files and the PDF final document
- `tikz` directory contains Tikz latex files only
- `figs` directory contains generated PDF and PNG files from `tikz` source files
- `plots` PDF plots (e.g. experiments results). I usually create my PDF plots using Python scripts (matplotlib) and need to convert them to PNG to embed them online or in my presentations

### Makefile
The `Makefile` has these targets:

- `figs` generates PDF and PNG files from Tikz files in `tikz` directory
- `plots` generates PNG files from PDF files in `plots` directory
- `all` pdflatex
- `clean_figs` removes the temporary files generated by `make figs`
- `clean` removes all temporary files

### Steps

- Rename the `template.tex` file to your `<project>.tex`
- Modify the target in `Makefile` from `template` to `<project>`
- Add required PDF files generated from Tikz sources in Makefile.inc
- Make sure you install pdflatex
- `make figs && make` :)
